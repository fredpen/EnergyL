Good Morning, 

Thanks for the chat yesterday.

I have some questions to give me better context to some part of the task.

Two user types: Primary contact and Authorised user
what are the roles of the two user ?
Is Authorised user also refer to as customer ?
is the primary contact also the one highlighted in item 6?
is primary contact allowed to also login or they are there for information purpose only?
